   - Bulk deletions

2. **Assistant Email Integration**
   - Direct email communication with your assistant
   - Automated notifications
   - File attachment handling

3. **Additional Features**
   - Advanced query caching
   - Enhanced result pagination
   - Query optimization suggestions
   - Backup/restore operations

## Error Handling & Feedback

### What should I do if I encounter an error?
This is exactly what beta testing is for! When you hit an error:
1. Don't worry - every error helps improve the system
2. If the error persists, try breaking your request into smaller steps

### How are errors handled?
We're actively monitoring all errors in real-time:
- Each error is logged and analyzed
- Fixes are often implemented within minutes
- System improvements are made based on error patterns
- Your patience during this process helps make alfrd better

### Why might I see different behavior at different times?
During beta, we're constantly improving the system:
- Real-time updates may change behavior
- Error handling is being refined
- Performance optimizations are ongoing
- New features are being tested

## Best Practices for Beta Testing

### How can I help improve alfrd?
1. **Use the System Regularly**
   - Try different types of operations
   - Experiment with various data structures
   - Test edge cases

2. **Be Patient with Errors**
   - Each error helps us improve
   - We're watching and fixing in real-time
   - Retry operations after a few minutes

3. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic operations
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps

### What should I avoid?
During the beta phase:
- Don't rely on alfrd for critical production data yet
- Avoid large data operations (bulk import coming soon!)
- Don't assume consistent behavior during system updates

## Support & Communication

### How will I know about new features?
We'll keep you updated about:
- New feature releases
- System improvements
- Fixed issues
- Upcoming changes

### What if I need help?
Remember:
- This is a beta test - issues are expected and helpful
- Every error helps improve the system
- We're actively monitoring and making improvements
- Your patience and participation are valuable

## Future Development

### What's the long-term vision?
We're building alfrd to be:
